"LinkedIn Malicious Content Detection uses Python to detect and filter harmful posts on LinkedIn. It's customizable and reports to LinkedIn security team, making the platform safer."

###Description:

This repository contains a Python-based system for detecting and filtering malicious content on LinkedIn. The aim of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient way of identifying potentially harmful discussions and posts on LinkedIn and reporting them to LinkedIn's security team. The system works by analyzing various parameters, such as keywords, patterns, and user behavior, to identify suspicious content. 
Once identified, the system automatically flags the content and generates a report that is sent to LinkedIn's security team for review. The code in this repository is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing users to adapt the system to their specific needs. The repository includes a detailed user guide and documentation to help users get started with the system.

With this system, we hope to provide a valuable tool for improving the safety and security of the LinkedIn platform.
